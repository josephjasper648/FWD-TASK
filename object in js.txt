OBJECTS IN JAVASCRIPT

Object in javascript is a data type, everything in javascript is consider as a object. 
Objects is described as a property with the combination of Key & value. 
There are lot of ways to create a object. Particulary object constructor syntax and literal syntax. Since, the easiest method to create an object is literal syntax method.
-	Object constructor syntax
Const (obj) = new obj ( )
-	Literal syntax 
Const (obj) = { }
Let see accessible of  object’s literal syntax
   An object is consist of property and method,
Property: Property is key value pairs and the key is an identifier of the object.
Method: A function which is present inside the object is called method
For example:
const person = {
    firstName:"james",
    lastName:"zones",
    age:24,
    parent:{
        father:"jack",
        mother:"Jessy"
    },
    Name: function( ) {
    console.log( this.firstName + " "+ this.lastName )
    } 
}
To access the object’s properties with the following syntax

person.firstName

	james 

person.parent.father

	 jack 
Inorder to access the method need to specify “( )” as usual to call function
 And particulary the syntax “.this” is use to access the key inside the object.

person.Name()

	james zones
n modern javascript we don’t need to specify as

Name: function(){
    console.log(this.firstName+" "+this.lastName)
    } 
Just to denote the method use propery theneven get the same result
Name( ){
    console.log(this.firstName+" "+this.lastName)
    }
}
To merge the two objects using the syntax
We already have an object “person” and then we introduce the new object  as

const newPerson = {
favcolour:"Black",
blood:"B+ve"
}
Let merge the two objects using the syntax 

object.assign (person,newPerson)

1.	Name: ƒ ()
2.	age: 24
3.	blood: "B+ve"
4.	favcolour: "Black"
5.	firstName: "james"
6.	lastName: "zones"
7.	parent: {father: 'jack', mother: 'Jessy'}

SPREAD
     This merge action also could be done with another syntax called spread operator.
const spread = {...person, ...newPerson}

console.log(spread)

1.	Name: ƒ ()
2.	age: 24
3.	blood: "B+ve"
4.	favcolour: "Black"
5.	firstName: "james"
6.	lastName: "zones"
7.	parent: {father: 'jack', mother: 'Jessy'}
This operator copies the object one by one and paste it.

DELETE

    Just to mention the key to delete the property  
delete person.parent
	true

person

1.	Name: ƒ Name()
2.	age: 24
3.	firstName: "james"
4.	lastName: "zones

ADD

  To add a new property just to mention the new key and the value
person.married = "single"
	single

person

1.	Name: ƒ Name()
2.	age: 24
3.	firstName: "james"
4.	lastName: "zones"
5.	married: "single"
